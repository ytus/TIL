## How to find when was a file deleted

> git log -- */fileName.xyz

or, if it shows nothing: 

> git log --full-history */fileName.xyz

Thanks to `*/` you don't have to write the full path to the file and `--full-history` will force git to skip "history simplification", see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/34755406 .
