## React + flowtype

The return type of `render()` is `?React$Element<any>`, see: https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L32 

Flow types for React are here: https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L226
(the rest of basic (core) types are there as well: https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/lib ).


> Error: ... Flow: property `children`. Property not found in props of React element `...`

This issue is not solved yet. Workaround is to specify `defaultProps`:

```
	props: {
		children: ?React$Element<any>
	};

	static defaultProps: {
		children: null;
	};
```
