### Enter doesn't press the selected button in pop-up dialog

When you select a button in a pop-up dialog with arrow keys, pressing `Enter` will still press the ogiriginally hignlighted button with blue background. This is a feature, not a bug. To press the selected button, use `Space`. 

> Looks like this is a standard UI behaviour on Mac - Enter activates default button, while Space activates focused button.
