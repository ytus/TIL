### Vim
copy & paste: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Copy,_cut_and_paste

    Cut and paste:
    
      Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
      Press v to select characters (or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks).
      Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
      Press d to cut (or y to copy).
      Move to where you would like to paste.
      Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after. 
    
    Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:
    
      d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut
      y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy 
      
(And the text is available through middle-click outside of Vim.)

### Functional programming
Functional programming is based on lambda calculus and that is based on mathematics. In mathematics you can have a set of numbers, but you can't change this set to suddenly contain different numbers. Instead, you will use another (different) set. That is why functional languages use immutalbe data structures. They works the same way math works.

### Flowtype

* Type `Object` can be a _starting point_ for other types. It can be used as any other type. For example this is OK (no flowtype errors):

~~~ js
/* @flow */

type A = {
  getX: () => string
}

function foo(o: Object): A {
  return o; // <-- we can return `o` as type `A` without errors
}
~~~

* When using the `$Keys<T>` type, don't forget to specify the generic type with a constraint `: Object`. So instead of:

  ~~~ js
  function getter<B>(prop: $Keys<B>, b: B) {
    return b[prop];
  }
  ~~~
  
  use:
  
  ~~~ js
  function getter<B: Object>(prop: $Keys<B>, b: B) {
    return b[prop];
  }
  ~~~
  othwerwise flow will complain with an error `access of computed property/element. Computed property/element cannot be accessed on`.
