### Vim
copy & paste: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Copy,_cut_and_paste

    Cut and paste:
    
      Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
      Press v to select characters (or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks).
      Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
      Press d to cut (or y to copy).
      Move to where you would like to paste.
      Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after. 
    
    Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:
    
      d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut
      y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy 
      
(And the text is available through middle-click outside of Vim.)
