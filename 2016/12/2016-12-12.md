## flowtype

* When destructuring an object, adding types this way doesn't work:

  ~~~ javascript
  const { id: number, name: string } = row;
  ~~~

  because that's exactly the way to destructure _into_ a variable with different name than the original field (i.e. here it means initialize the `const number` with the value of `row.id`).
  
  Add the types like this instead:

  ~~~ javascript
  const { id, name }: { id: number, name: string } = row;
  ~~~
