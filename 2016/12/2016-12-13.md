## redux-loop (+ promise + catch)
* When creating an `Effect.promise(functionThatReturnsPromise)`, the promise returned from `functionThatReturnsPromise` should resolve with an action. But don't forget to add a `catch()` handler to that promise and it should return an action too! (Of course, most likely it will be some other action.)

## ESLint
* The rules `no-unused-vars` allows us ot define a pattern, that it will ignore, for example to ignore names that starts with undescore: 
~~~
  'no-unused-vars': ['error', {
			vars: 'local', varsIgnorePattern: '^_',
			args: 'after-used', argsIgnorePattern: '^_' }],
~~~
