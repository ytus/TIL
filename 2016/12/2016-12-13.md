## redux-loop (+ promise + catch)
* When creating an `Effect.promise(functionThatReturnsPromise)`, the promise returned from `functionThatReturnsPromise` should resolve with an action. But don't forget to add a `catch()` handler to that promise and it should return an action too! (Of course, most likely it will be some other action.)
