## redux-loop (+ promise + catch)
* When creating an `Effect.promise(functionThatReturnsPromise)`, the promise returned from `functionThatReturnsPromise` should resolve with an action. But don't forget to add a `catch()` handler to that promise and it should return an action too! (Of course, most likely it will be some other action.)

## ESLint
* The rules `no-unused-vars` allows to define a pattern, that it will ignore. For example to ignore names that start with an undescore: 
~~~ javascript
  'no-unused-vars': ['error', {
    vars: 'local', varsIgnorePattern: '^_',
    args: 'after-used', argsIgnorePattern: '^_' }],
~~~
