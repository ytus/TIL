* `{| |}` defines an exact type

* `required module not found` 

  Maybe the folder `node_modules` is in the ignore section in `.flowconfig`?

[ignore]
.*/fbjs/.*

* The tilde arrow`(~>)` in a type signature is probably a call of _that_ specific method on an instance of a type. For example here `ap :: Apply f => f a ~> f (a -> b) -> f b` it means calling `ap(...)` on an instance of Apply with an argument of type `f (a -> b)`.
