## flowtype

`{| |}` defines an exact type

### `required module not found` 

  Maybe the folder `node_modules` is in the ignore section in `.flowconfig`? (Remove it.)
  ~~~
[ignore]
.*/fbjs/.*
.*/node_modules/.*
  ~~~
  
  Or restart flow:
  ~~~
  $> npm run flow -- stop
  $> npm run flow
  ~~~

### =>
> equals :: Setoid a => a -> a -> Bool
>
> The => is new notation. What this means is that the signature to its right is valid if all the conditions to its left are satisfied. In the case of equals, the signature a -> a -> Bool is valid if a is a Setoid.

### ~>

* The tilde arrow`(~>)` in a type signature is a call of _that_ specific method on an instance of a type. For example here `ap :: Apply f => f a ~> f (a -> b) -> f b` it means calling `ap(...)` on an instance of Apply with an argument of type `f (a -> b)`.
 
 Or:

> equals :: Setoid a => a ~> a -> Bool
>
> The ~> is the new symbol here. What this means is that equals is a method on the thing to the left of ~>, and the thing to the right is its signature.
