## React + flowtype

* The return type of `render()` is `?React$Element<any>`, see: https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L32 

* Flow types for React are here: https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L226 (the rest of basic (core) types are there as well: https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/lib ).


* > Error: ... Flow: property `children`. Property not found in props of React element `...`

  This issue is not solved yet. Workaround is to specify `defaultProps` this way:

  ~~~ javascript
class SomeComponent extends React.Component {
	props: {
		children: ?React$Element<any>
	};

	static defaultProps: {
		children: null;
	};
  ~~~

  Changing `propTypes` into flow types in a component that is a `class` means defining the props as an instance field called `props` _inside_ of the class (like above).
