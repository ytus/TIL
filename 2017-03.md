## `Array.reduce` doesn't need the initial value

_"If `initialValue` is provided in the call to reduce, 
then `accumulator` will be equal to `initialValue` and `currentValue` will be equal to the first value in the array. 
If no `initialValue` was provided, then accumulator will be equal to the first value in the array 
and `currentValue` will be equal to the second."_

## Object destructuring and default values

It's possible to use destructuring to retrieve a value from a hierarchy of objects even if some part of it is missing: 

~~~ js
const present = {
  first: {
    second: {
      third: {
        value: 'something'
      }
    }
  }
};

const missing = {
  // no `first`
};

const {first: {second: {third: {value: v1}}}={}} = present;
console.log('v1=', v1); // -> "v1=" "something"

const {first: {second: {third: {value: v2}={}}={}}={}} = missing;
console.log('v2=', v2); // -> "v2=" undefined (and no errors!)
~~~
