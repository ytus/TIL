## `Array.reduce` doesn't need the initial value

_"If `initialValue` is provided in the call to reduce, 
then `accumulator` will be equal to `initialValue` and `currentValue` will be equal to the first value in the array. 
If no `initialValue` was provided, then accumulator will be equal to the first value in the array 
and `currentValue` will be equal to the second."_
